# python_personal_website_launcher & desktop application launcher - Now known as python_personal_launcher
This is a simple application created using python - its purpose is quite simple, the user needs to input an integer - say the user inputs 1, it will use the 'webbrowser' import to launch the YouTube website, if in the case the User inputs 2 - it will launch Google, it also makes use of win10Toast essentially creating a windows desktop notification notifying the user which website will be launched.

I've now slowly started to add the support of being able to launch my chosen selection of applications that i find most used within my day to day life.
